## Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio of apps and projects which I have created during my studies and which I keep up-to-date with new apps I create.

My apps range more recently created Full-Stack apps with React, interactive HTML, CSS, JS apps to simpler vanilla JavaScript projects such as a calculator, todo app and Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Project Status

I will be constantly adding and updating this project to reflect my ongoing progress.

## Reflection

- This week-long project is a culmination of my studying over the past few months. I began teaching myself Web Development as a consideration for a career change. As I began applying for positions I created this site to showcase my projects and apps from my learning process.

- I set out to create a site that reflected my personality, looked impressive, had good functionality and was complete. I wanted it to show-off my projects & skills and be a good show of my current abilities as a web developer. I hope that potential employees or clients will be able to understand what skills I have and what I can create - and feel that I would be useful as a member of their team.

- This project is one of only a few React projects I have created. Although it isn't demanding in terms of function it was a bigger challenge to create a good-looking site with SASS and ensure it works well across all browsers and all screen-sizes. This has been a great challenge, creating this single-page site with animated components.

- Obstacles I was faced with include many CSS compatibility issues across browsers. I overcame many of these by adapting my HTML structure and implementing better practices for positioning elements and re-sizing elements across screen-sizes. It helped me to be more effective with my CSS implementation and minimize a 'trial and error' approach.

  - The slider element was a significant obstacle for me - I made an attempt to create this myself but the use of an NPM package eventually meant I could concentrate I getting the site up and running. This is certainly an area I wish to revisit to ensure I have the means to create such an element with pure JS.

- For this project I used React and SASS within VSCode. I find these tools to be the most helpful in creating a site efficiently and quickly. Within my project I used some NPM packages; react-scroll react-scroll-to-element and animate.css. These were used to add most of the dynamic animation effects to my site. Where it would be good to implement this using Vanilla JS I decided that for the sake of time I would use a package to acheive these effects.

  - React-Create-App is helpful for getting a React App up and running quickly. I prefer this method and to strip out unused code.
  - SASS allows me to access elements very quickly and create neater CSS code. I use variables and mixins to add global values which make adjustments much easier and quicker. I can also link seperate SCSS files to my main file to keep components' styles seperate and organised - this makes finding & adjusting values clear and quick

## Future Improvements/Features

- I intend for this site to be continually added to as my projects increase & improve.
- I would like to spend time considering all Accesibility issues there may be with my site.
- I would like to recreate the slider with my own code
- As I add skills I will update the skills section to reflect these
