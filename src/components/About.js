        I began learning to program & developed websites in 2020. I’m usually a
        full-time musician - working in London & touring UK/Europe with theatre
        productions alongside freelancing and teaching. <br />
        <br />
        During lockdown this work dried up and like many musicians I was forced
        to look elsewhere for income. I began my journey learning Python and
        from that a natural path into Web Development. Exploring HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript I pushed through steep learning curves and endless moments of
        frustration! As I learnt more, my appetite to discover new technologies
        and develop my skills grew until I find myself here today.
        <br />
        <br />I am self-taught, but don’t let that put you off. I’ve been
        thorough in my learning, following numerous courses, reading books and
        being active on GitHub, StackOverflow and CodeWars. All in an attempt to
        be a better Web Developer than I was yesterday. I hope you enjoy my
        portfolio site. <br />
